## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

Majorly, I learnt about styling buttons.

```css
.cancel-btn:hover {
  cursor: pointer;
}
```

### Useful resources

- [w3schools](https://www.w3shools.com) - This helped me with majority of the CSS stylings. The explanations were easy to understand and the examples were easy to replicate.
